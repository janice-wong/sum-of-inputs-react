## Description

Using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) exercise as a base, I updated this app to do the following things:
- Provide the sum given two numeric inputs
- Allow the user to add additional numeric inputs
- Provide a live update of the sum of all numbers

To run this app, run the following command and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm start`
